# Go For PlanningPoker
üÉè PlanningPoker is a collaborative tool for agile teams to estimate tasks using the Planning Poker technique. It consists of a server and a terminal-based client UI written in Go.

## Features
- Create or Join Rooms: Host can create a new room; participants can join with a code.
- Real-time Voting: Participants select their estimates; votes are revealed once everyone has voted.
- Live Participant List: See who is in the room and who has voted.
- Room Cleanup: Inactive/empty rooms are cleaned up automatically.
- Terminal UI: Client uses a modern TUI for smooth navigation.
